# Adapter interface for proxyist

Proxyist is a web proxy which provides an object store like interface to a catalog of items which contain objects.


This library provides common code for adapters. You should never need to add
this as a dependency but you might import errors from it for configuration of
adapters.

## Installation

Do not install this unless you are writing your own adapter.

```bash
yarn add proxyist-adapter-ocfl
```
